# Physics-problems

# This is where I put the physics problems that I've come up with. These are usually ones I created for olympiads.
# That doesn't mean they are definitely completely original and have never appeared anywhere else. But to my knowledge I came up with them myself.

# Naturally, because of the competitive nature of physics olympiads, problems that I could but have not yet appeared in an olympiad are not published here.

# List & topics:
# TBD
